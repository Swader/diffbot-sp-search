#Changelog
All notable changes will be documented in this file

## 0.2.1 - June 16th, 2015

- fixed the "No results" message (was not displayed previously)
- fixed crash on no results
- made the author search be a little bit more creative. Instead of looking for the full author string at once, it will look for author strings containing all the words - so order of last and first name becomes irrelevant.

## 0.2 - June 15th, 2015

- added Google Analytics
- increased number of returned search results
- removed duplicate entries, post-fetch. Current limitation of Search API.
- added main image to search results, if any are available in article. If not, fallback to channel icon.
- updated README
