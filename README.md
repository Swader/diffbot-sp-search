# Diffbot-powered SitePoint Search Engine

This is a machine-learning powered search engine for SitePoint's content.

[Diffbot](http://diffbot.com) extracts and structures the data (more info on that [here](http://sitepoint.com/tag/diffbot) and provides API points to query these harvested collections.

The crawling is repeated with 24 hour breaks, making sure that the content of the collection is never more than a couple of days old.

Live version at http://search.sitepoint.tools

Detailed tutorial on how each part was built (including the crawling and searching mechanics) coming soon.
